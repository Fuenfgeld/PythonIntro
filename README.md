Welcome to our fun and engaging **Python Introduction for Healthcare professional** course! This course is designed for students who want to learn Python with a focus on the healthcare domain. Get ready to level up your Python skills and make a difference in healthcare! :stethoscope:

## :bookmark_tabs: [Syntax, Variables, and DataTypes Lesson](https://github.com/Fuenfgeld/PythonIntro/blob/main/SyntaxVariablesDataTypes.ipynb)

### :pencil: 1. [Python Syntax](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A7bYUT7AlJkbAOwrN_AWvdnjrcdT8xqG#scrollTo=rSZfmTh2o1Sl&line=2&uniqifier=1) :memo:

In this lesson, we'll introduce you to Python's **easy-to-read** and **clean syntax**! You'll learn about:
- Indentation :straight_ruler:
- Comments :speech_balloon:
- Writing and executing Python code :running:

We'll also work on a healthcare-related problem to give you hands-on experience! :muscle:

### :floppy_disk: 2. [Variables](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A7bYUT7AlJkbAOwrN_AWvdnjrcdT8xqG#scrollTo=1JOqoWGPlGGK&line=1&uniqifier=1) :clipboard:

Next, we'll explore **variables** - the building blocks of any Python program! You'll learn:
- Creating and using variables :pencil2:
- Assigning values to variables :arrow_right:

We'll calculate a patient's BMI (Body Mass Index) using variables in a healthcare example. :weight_lifting:

### :books: 3. [Data Types](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A7bYUT7AlJkbAOwrN_AWvdnjrcdT8xqG#scrollTo=sacKp2GFnCcq&line=4&uniqifier=1) :card_index:

In this lesson, we'll journey through Python's various **data types**! We'll cover:
- Integers :1234:
- Floats :droplet:
- Strings :abcd:
- Booleans :bulb:
- Lists :bookmark_tabs:
- Tuples :pushpin:
- Sets :busts_in_silhouette:
- Dictionaries :book:

With healthcare examples, we'll demonstrate how to use each data type effectively, like managing patient data or analyzing health-related stats. :bar_chart:

:sparkles: Throughout the course, we'll provide **fun examples** and **exciting exercises** to help you become a Python healthcare pro! :rocket: So get ready to dive into Python and make an impact in healthcare! :stethoscope:
